# My First Kotlin Calculator Project

Welcome to my first Kotlin calculator project! This project marks a stepping stone in my journey with Kotlin, as I explore its syntax and features while also learning Java. While I am primarily focusing on Java, I am eager to delve into Kotlin, considering it as a language that I wish to explore more extensively in the future.

## Features

- **Console-Based Calculator**: Implement a simple calculator application that operates in the console, accepting user input for arithmetic operations.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Support basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Input Handling**: Handle user input through the console and perform calculations based on the input provided.

Thank you for exploring my first Kotlin calculator project! ðŸ§®ðŸš€
